Twice at blog.jayantbhawal.in, twice at ideabuster.jayantbhawal.in.</p><p>The first 3 times, it was more for a \"let's see how this is done\" reason. The 4th or so time, it was that, plus to actually add some content, which is there on blog.jayantbhawal.in.</p><p>However, the blog hosted on the current link is... kinda slow. It's Wordpress based, so it's pretty easy to use and publish content from, but it can be painfully slow to load on not-excellent networks. Doesn't look too good for a frontend developer now, does it?</p><p>So here's my... 5th attempt at this?  A gatsby based blog site! All the cool kids are doing it!  It allows me great extensibility though, like, you'll find posts where you can write, edit, and preview React examples right on the page itself, and interact with it too! Who needs codepen or jsfiddle for these things? (Probably me, for more complex examples.)</p><p>This is great though. It's fast, it's simple, basically no bloat, etc. Needs a bit more work, and I'm looking forward to it. :)</p>",
