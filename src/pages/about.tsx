          UI/UX developer. Super passionate. {getExperience()} years of XP in UI Web and still levelling up. React +

          I'm a frontend developer, with <em>full-time</em> experience of a bit over {getExperience()}.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, I've worked with people like{' '}

          <Titled

              'And some exceptionally skilled friends from here including Sherub Thakur, Dhruv Agarwal, Raghav Dua, etc.'
            }

            so many more
          </Titled>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          So far I've worked on quite a wide variety of things, from your everyday static site, to super data-intensive
          user interfaces, to stuff that is so far from the UI domain that I was basically a proper backend and dev-ops
          guy for that time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've pushed hard for <Titled title={'LogRocket, FullStory, Hotjar...\nOne at a time.'}>tools</Titled> that let
          us track user experience on my projects, and made excellent use of that data to fix annoyances and
          inconveniences that no one knew they could complain about.
          <br />
          <small>
            People actually complain way less than they should about UX issues and annoyances because they don't know
            their voices matter. I like to change that where I work.
          </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          I care deeply for a great user experience regardless of the platform, so the finer details of building layouts
          and the science of user interactions with interfaces is of paramount importance to me.
        </p>
