        <p>
          I'm am what you'll call a <em>casual</em> gamer. I play a ton of different games, though I tend to avoid ones
          with much grinding, and any competitive gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's hardly any genre of game that I've not played, except the Anime style ones. Not that I hate anime, I
          like a few of them,{' '}
          <Titled title={'Followed by Death Note, till L dies.'}>FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</Titled> being my
          favorite one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, like almost everyone out there, Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is one of my all-time favorites, but
          Spider-Man PS4 has a special place in my heart. I'm a big Halo fan too, here's hoping Halo: Infinite is a
          crazy entry to the franchise. However, most of my playtime is in multiplayer games or game-modes, shouldn't be
          surprising I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love going out to nice places to have a meal, how mainstream of me you might think{' '}
          <span role={'img'}>ðŸ˜›</span>. And there will always be a special place for <strong>Garlic Bread</strong> in my
          tummy, and heart (title of my autopsy report).
        </p>
        <p>
          If I seem like the kind of guy you want to chat or chill with, you can{' '}
          <ExternalLink to={'https://twitter.com/jayantbhawal'}>tweet</ExternalLink> at me or{' '}
          <ExternalLink to={'mailto:bhawal.jayant@gmail.com'}>email</ExternalLink> me, assuming you don't have my
