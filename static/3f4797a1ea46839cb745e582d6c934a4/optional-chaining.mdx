title: Optional Chaining is ‚ù§
desc:
  Looking up nested properties doesn't need to be painful. It used to be, and
  not it isn't anymore! Thanks TC39!

Let's look at a use-case that's not too uncommon:

```js
const definition =
  dictionary.words &&
  dictionary.words.apple &&
  dictionary.words.apple.definition;
```

Oh my, that's an eyeful. All I wanted to get was the definition of apple, if
present, in a user-created dictionary, meaning that the initial state of this
dictionary could possibly be completely empty.

This has been a little painful, and has been a thing since years.

## We've had "solutions" since long too

The fine creators of [coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/) did indeed solve
this issue in a way. They introduced the
[_Existential Operator_](https://coffeescript.org/#existential-operator), and
this is how that looked like:

```coffeescript
solipsism = true if mind? and not world?

speed = 0
speed ?= 15

footprints = yeti ? "bear"

zip = lottery.drawWinner?().address?.zipcode
```

Amazing right? Though a lot of this stuff has come into JS, it didn't make an
as-is introduction. In fact, many other languages too had the optional chaining
operator with them, and a lot of discussion was had before they arrived on the
best solution that would play nice in JS. A lot of the stuff from the
coffeescript example doesn't exist nicely in JS.

That exact example would look like this in JS:

```js
// solipsism = true if mind? and not world?

// speed = 0
// speed ?= 15

footprints = yeti ?? "bear" // nullish coalescing

zip = lottery.drawWinner?().address?.zipcode // optional chaining

// Hence, the first example would look like:
const definition = dictionary.words?.apple?.definition;
```

I am a straight up fan of this thing, and I've been tracking progress of this
since a year before it released!

Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing are now in Stage 4, and released into
some major browsers. It was added to TypeScript 3.7 a week after it was moved to
Stage 3. Soon afterwards, it was added to `react-scripts 3.3.0-next.62` (with
TS), and was released in the stable 3.3 build of react-scripts.
