Recently I discovered [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys). If
you don't know about this, then congratulations because you should totally
install this right now. It surely has something you can make use of!

PowerToys is basically a set of tools that are *nice-to-have*s for most people.
It's things like a Color Picker, Window Zones, Spotlight (from MacOS), Bulk
Rename, etc. As of this date, there are 9 tools in total.

<summary>Color Picker</summary>
Literally a system-wide color picker that supports Hex, RGB, and HSL!

<summary>Fancy Zones</summary>
Windows already had some seriously solid window tiling, but fancy zones takes it to the next level!

<details>
  <summary>Image Resizer</summary>
  Bulk Image resizing. It's not something I would use often, but there have been
  times when I had to use [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) to achieve this
  functionality.

<details>
<summary>Keyboard Manager</summary>
I'll probably not use this much either, but again, it's a great feature by itself!

<details>
<summary>Power Rename</summary>
There were a few times when I had to use third-party tools to do this.

<details>
<summary>PowerToys Run (Spotlight)</summary>
SO MUCH YES! This is basically MacOS's Spotlight, though slightly limited in functionality. But this is so good nonetheless!

<summary>Shortcut Guide</summary>
It's useful sometimes... sometimes.

<summary>Video Conference Mute</summary>
I guess it's handy if you can't disable mic/cam by other means.

My favorites are Fancy Zones, and PowerToys Run.

**Fancy Zones** allows me to create custom layout grids that I can snap windows
to using hotkeys (Win + Left/Right). It's exceptionally useful when I want a
dashboard like setup going on with multiple windows. For example: I'm writing
some code, but I don't need the whole screen for that. So the top half of the
remaining half of the screen is taken up by Slack, and the bottom half by
Discord or something!

**PowerToys Run** is just so good for when I want to launch an app, or do quick
math. I don't need to pin a dozen things to my taskbar anymore, or find an icon
on the desktop, or start menu. You know, basically do Spotlight things!

I can't however, do currency conversions in it yet.
