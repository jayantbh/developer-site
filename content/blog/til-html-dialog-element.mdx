The [Dialog
Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) is
basically a dialog (duh) all with backdrop support and everything, so in many
cases you may not need a third party lib to make a dialog. It has native JS APIs
too for opening and closing it. _Note: Browser Support is a little hairy._

Here's a hosted example on glitch.me (though you have an example right on this page too):
[https://peaceful-meowing-yogurt.glitch.me/](https://peaceful-meowing-yogurt.glitch.me/).

> NOTE: Check the MDN Docs linked above to see if your browser supports this.

All you need to do to toggle a dialog is:

```js live
const toggle = () => {
  let dialog = document.querySelector('dialog#d--1');

  if (!dialog.hasAttribute('open')) {
    dialog.showModal();
  } else {
    dialog.removeAttribute('open');
  }
}

const Dialog = styled.dialog`
  color: red;

  &::backdrop {
    background: rgba(255, 200, 200, 0.6);
  }
`;

render(
  <div>
    <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle Dialog</button>
    <Dialog id='d--1' onClick={toggle}>Default Dialog</Dialog>
  </div>
)
```

When the dialog is triggered to be open, the `open` attribute is automatically
added to it, which can be used to detect if it's open or not.

And as you see, you can format the backdrop of the dialog using CSS!

When I was writing this, I faced an issue that I do not yet know how to solve.
When you open and close the dialog, user selection or text editing on the page
stops working. If you figure it out, <ExternalLink
